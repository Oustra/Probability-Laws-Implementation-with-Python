# Probability Laws Implementation with Python
# Description
This repository contains implementations of various probability laws using Python with matplotlib and numpy libraries. Currently, the implemented probability laws include:

- Poisson Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Normal Distribution
- Exponential Distribution
- Confidence Intervals
Each implementation provides functionality to visualize the probability distributions and calculate relevant statistics using matplotlib and numpy.
